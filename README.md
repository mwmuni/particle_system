# Simulate particles for no reason!

If you want a decent reason, just up the particles to 20k and set the thread count to the number of cores you have for some great CPU burn-in!

# Main Features

This O($n^2$) black box of doom will calculate a repelling force between every particle _in real time_!

Requires SDL2 (included with release for windows).

Has flags for non-windows targets, so it should compile on other OSes.
